# Stellar Feedback

## Stellar winds

As described in detail in [Wall et al. (2020)][1], Torch incorporates stellar
winds by updating the mass, velocity and internal energy in an injection region
around each star driving a wind. The update is performed based on the mechanical
luminosity of the star

$$
L_w = \frac{1}{2}\dot{M}\,v_w^2,
$$

where the mass loss rate $\dot{M}$ and wind velocity $v_w$ are computed and set
in FLASH using the AMUSE interface. The choice of wind physical parameters 
(i.e. mass loss rate and velocity) is controlled 
by a parameter in `torch_user.py` using one of the following arguments:
```
massloss_method = 'seba' or 'leit' or 'puls'
```
The methods are compared below. We recommend setting 
```
massloss_method = 'seba'
```
For every method, the mass loss rates are calculated either from a mass loss recipe 
implemented directly in `torch_se.py` (for the  `'leit'` and `'puls'` options) or
by the `SeBa` stellar evolution code (from a mass loss prescription in the code). 
The velocities are set directly in `torch_se.py` for every method. 

The `'leit'` option calculates mass loss rates and velocities based on 
[Leitherer et. al. 1992][2]. The `'puls'` option calculates them from 
[Kudritzki & Puls 2000][3] and [Vink et al. 2000][4]. For the `'seba'` option, 
the velocities are set in `torch_se.py` using [Leitherer et. al. 1992][2], and 
the mass loss rates are set by the `SeBa` stellar evolution code, which is based 
on [Vink et al. 2000][4] with a pre-factor of 1/3 to match modern mass loss
rates estimates. An option to use the mass loss rates from `SeBa` with the velocities 
from Kudritzki & Puls is currently available in the `develop` branch as `'seba_puls'`.

Different options for the wind injection are shown in Figure {numref}`fig-wind-bubbles`
and described in further detail in this section.

```

### Injection region
The injection region is defined by an injection radius $r_{\rm inj}$ set in
`flash.par` using
```
ref_radius = -1.0
```
If a negative value is supplied, Torch uses the default

$$
r_{\rm inj} = 3.5\sqrt{3}\,\Delta,
$$

where $\Delta$ is the local cell width. The factor of $\sqrt{3}$ ensures
that the kernel extends to the corners of a cube spanning $7\times7\times7$
cells, corresponding to an effective kernel radius of 3.5 cells along each
Cartesian direction. Note that the injection radius must be at least
$\sqrt{3}\Delta$, i.e. spanning the corner of an oct.

Rather than treating cells as either fully inside or outside the injection
region, Torch computes the fractional overlap between each cell and the
spherical injection kernel. The fractional overlap is calculated using the
algorithm from ZEUS-MP ([Hayes et al., 2006][6]), modified with a tapered
center-weighting. The injection region is illustrated in {numref}`fig-wind-overlap`.

In addition to weighting the injection by the overlap kernel, the injection is 
modified as a function of radial distance using the solid angle of a square with 
side length equal to a cell size following [Mathar (2022)][7]

$$
\Omega   = 4\cos^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{1+\Delta^2/(2\,r^2)}{1+\Delta^2/(2\,r^2)+(\Delta^2/4\,r^2)^2}}
$$


In this way, the injection is weighted by a radial factor that depends on how much of
the wind a cell "sees". Note that this option is turned off when using mass loading.

### Injection strategy

The wind material distributed over the injection region can be added using one of
two update schemes, selected through the `cons_quant` parameter:

```
cons_quant = "momentum" or "energy"
```

#### Momentum-conserving injection

The default method conserves mass and vector momentum. In each cell, the
injected mass is added to the existing gas, and the new velocity is obtained by
conserving the total momentum of the cell,

$$
(\rho\mathbf{v})_{\rm new} = (\rho\mathbf{v})_{\rm old} + (\rho\mathbf{v})_{\rm wind}.
$$

Because the injected material mixes with gas that may already have a different
velocity, this likely results in a loss of kinetic energy during the update.
The resulting kinetic energy is generally smaller than the injected mechanical
energy, and is typically assumed to have been converted into unresolved small-
scale motion.

By using the parameter
```
add_therm_e = .true.
```
the missing kinetic energy is added back as thermal energy so that the total
injected mechanical energy is conserved. This provides a momentum-conserving
update that also conserves the injected mechanical luminosity. Note that if the 
required thermal correction would be negative, no thermal energy is added to 
that cell. Furthermore, without adding this missing energy, the internal energy 
of the cell is gradually dissipated. In rare cases, this cause cells to reach 
zero internal energy, thereby triggering a crash.

#### Energy-conserving injection

When

```text
cons_quant = "energy"
```

the velocity update is instead constructed to preserve the injected kinetic
energy rather than the vector momentum. In this scheme, the specific kinetic
energy of the mixture is conserved, but the resulting velocity does not, in
general, satisfy momentum conservation. This option exists primarily for
comparison with earlier implementations and idealized tests, while the
momentum-conserving method is recommended for most applications.

### Mass loading
Torch simulations can be dramatically sped-up by applying mass loading to the 
injected wind material. Therefore cluster-scale production runs often employ 
mass loading. Mass loading can be turned on by setting

```text
mass_load = .true.
```

When enabled, the injected wind mass is adjusted so that the wind reaches a
user-specified target temperature,

```text
wind_target_temp = 1e6
```

The target temperature is converted to a reference wind velocity assuming a
fully ionized gas,

$$
v_{\rm ref} = 10^8 \sqrt{\frac{T_{\rm target}}{1.38\times10^7{\rm \, K}}}
\ {\rm cm \, s^{-1}},
$$

following Equation 36.28 of [Draine (2011)][7]. The injected wind velocity is then
set to $v_{\rm ref}$, while the injected mass is adjusted to conserve either
the injected momentum or kinetic energy, depending on the selected injection
scheme (`cons_quant`).

For momentum-conserving injection, the mass loading factor is

$$
f_{\rm load} = \frac{v_{\rm wind}}{v_{\rm ref}} - 1,
$$

while for energy-conserving injection it becomes

$$
f_{\rm load} = \left(\frac{v_{\rm wind}}{v_{\rm ref}}\right)^2 - 1.
$$

The injected mass is then scaled according to

$$
M_{\rm inj} = M_{\rm wind}\left(1 + f_{\rm load}\right).
$$

Figure {numref}`fig-mass-load` illustrates the approximate speed up and mass 
added as a function of the target temperature for a few wind velocities. Note 
that most feedback stars have wind velocities between 1000-3000 km/s.

:align: center

```

```{note}
Although this option is referred to as *mass loading*, the implementation also
permits **mass unloading**. If the reference velocity exceeds the input wind
velocity ($v_{\rm ref} > v_{w}$), the loading factor becomes negative,
reducing the injected mass instead of increasing it. This can occur for slow
winds or when a sufficiently high target temperature is chosen. Users should
therefore ensure that the selected target temperature is physically consistent
with the expected wind velocity.

### Variable radius
As an option, Torch supports a method for a variable injection radius, activated
using
```
var_radius = .true.
```
If used, the injection radius is updated at each timestep to match the radius
of the wind termination shock, estimated using the self-similar solution from
[Weaver et al. (1977)][7]

$$
R_1 = 0.9\,\alpha^{3/2}\,v_w^{1/10}\,t_w^{2/5}\,\left(\frac{\dot{M}}{\rho_0}\right)^{3/10},
$$

where $\alpha=0.88$, $\rho_0$ is the mean gas density at the location of the star 
when the wind turns on, and $t_w$ is the time since the wind turned on. When
using variable radius, another parameter can be used to limit the minimum radius
of the injection region
```
min_radius = 0.0
```

### Velocity pertubations

Torch can optionally add small cell-by-cell perturbations to the wind velocity
before the wind material is injected. This is controlled by

```
perturb_velocity = .true.
perturb_std_dev  = 0.05
```

When enabled, the magnitude of the wind velocity in each injection cell is
perturbed by a factor sampled from a normal distribution with width 
`perturb_std_dev`. Note that the perturbation factors are clipped at five 
standard deviations and forced to remain positive, preventing the wind
velocity from changing sign. After the perturbations are applied, the velocities
are renormalized so that the total injected kinetic energy remains equal to the
unperturbed wind kinetic energy.

This option was introduced to break the perfect spherical symmetry of the
injection pattern. Such symmetry can otherwise seed grid-aligned numerical
artifacts, especially in idealized test problems or highly symmetric setups.

````{warning}
Despite normalizing the perturbed velocities to conserve the total injected 
kinetic energy, this normalization is global over the injection region. 
Individual cells can still receive more kinetic energy than in the unperturbed 
case.

When using momentum-conserving injection with
```text
add_therm_e = .true.
```
the thermal-energy correction is computed cell by cell. Even small velocity
perturbations can therefore produce cells where the required thermal
compensation is negative. In such cases Torch sets the thermal correction to
zero in that cell, so the local energy compensation is no longer exact.

### Resolution test

four different resolutions, corresponding to minimum cell sizes ranging from 0.12 pc
to 0.015 pc.
